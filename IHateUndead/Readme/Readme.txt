1) Compatibility



The I Hate Undead Kitpack should be compatible with any mods. Tome and Blood (TnB) requires a workaround that I explain at item 4 and Faiths and Powers (FnP) is still going through adjustments. If you observe some odd behavior, please, contact Raduziel at Beamdog's forums.

This mod works for IWDEE, BGEE, BG2EE and EET. Anyone who wishes to convert this mod to vanilla feel free to do so, just keep the credits for the original work.

                                                                     

2) Installing Order


I Hate Undead Kitpack should be installed after any items mods, Faiths and Powers and Spells Revision.

I Hate Undead Kitpack should be installed before any mod that alters the proficiency system.



3) Know Issues That I Can't Do Nothing About

None

4) Using the Undead Slayer with TnB's component "Revised Specialists"

4.a) Enable the Console Commands;

4.b) Create a Good-alignment Necromancer with at least 16 CON;

4.c) While in the game, select only the Necromancer, leave the cursor on it and hit Ctrl + Space;

4.d) Type: C:Eval('AddKit(RAUS)') and hit Enter. Enjoy.



5) Credits



Lots of people helped me through this journey but I want to especially thank Gwendolyne and Kjeron. I feel like this mod is theirs as much as mine. The French translation is also a Gwendolyne job.

Grammarsalad for keeping my spirits up in the earlier stages of these kits when everything looked so damn hard and confusing.

CrevsDaak for the comprehensive guide that let me build these kits.

Subtledoctor for always lending me a hand and for the compatibility with FnP's sphere system.

And pretty much every modder at the community for providing thousand of mods that I studied and reverse-engineered - specially Avenger: the Wizard Slayer Rebalancing Mod was what made the Undead Hunter Revision possible.
